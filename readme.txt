Hello!
This updated version is XML compatible.
If you experience problems with this version since your PHP hasn't
been updated, use the hangman_old.php file which is the previous
version of my game.
At the moment the file that contains the words is parole.txt which
is enclosed.
You can change all the words in this file.

Now Hangman parses a template file so you can easily integrate my game
with your site.
Just take your template (any standard page of your site), edit it
with your favourite program (ie Notepad) and add the line
<!--HANGMAN-->
between two blank lines where you want to insert Hangman.
Save this file with the name base.html into the directory where you
put Hangman. Hangman will read this file and parse it with the game!
